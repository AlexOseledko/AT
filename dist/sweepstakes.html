              <p>
                This Sweepstakes is conducted in English. </p>
              <p> In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between the
                terms and conditions of these English Official Rules and the English Abbreviated Rules or other
                statements contained in any Sweepstakes-related materials, including, but not limited to: any entry
                form, survey, the Spanish version of these Official Rules and the Abbreviated Rules, and/or point of
                sale, television, print or online advertising; the terms and conditions of these English Official Rules
                shall prevail, govern and control. </p>
              <p> All federal, state and local taxes are the sole responsibility of the
                prize winners. </p>
              <p> By participating in this Sweepstakes, Entrants and prize winners agree to be bound by
                these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor and Sweepstakes Entities, which are final in all
                respects and not subject to appeal. </p>
              <p> Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify permanently from this
                Sweepstakes any Entrant it believes has violated these Official Rules and verify eligibility of
                Entrants. </p>
              <p> Neither Sponsor nor anyone acting on its behalf will enter into any communications with any
                Entrant regarding this Sweepstakes, except as expressly set forth in these Official Rules. </p>
              <p> By
                participating in this Sweepstakes, Entrants, and prize winners release the Sponsor and each and all of
                the Sweepstakes Entities, from any and all liability, damages or causes of action (however named or
                described) with respect to or arising out of participation in the Sweepstakes, and/or the receipt or
                use/misuse of any prize awarded, including, without limitation, liability for personal injury, death or
                property damage. </p>
              <p> Failure to comply with these Official Rules may result in disqualification from the
                Sweepstakes. </p>
              <p> All Sweepstakes materials are subject to verification and are void if (a) not obtained in
                accordance with these Official Rules and through legitimate channels, (b) any part is counterfeited,
                altered, defective, damaged, illegible, reproduced, tampered with, mutilated or irregular in any way,
                (c) are obtained where prohibited, or (d) they contain printing, typographical, mechanical, or other
                errors. </p>
              <p> Entrants assume all risk of loss, damage, destruction, delay or misdirection of Sweepstakes
                materials submitted to Sponsor. </p>
              <p> In the event any portion of this Sweepstakes is compromised by
                activities beyond the control of the Sponsor which, in the sole opinion of the Sponsor, corrupt or
                impair the administration, security, fairness or proper play of the Sweepstakes or this Sweepstakes,
                Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion to modify, suspend or terminate the Sweepstakes. </p>
              <p>
                Winning a prize constitutes permission for Sponsor and its agencies to use prize winners' names,
                addresses (city & state), voices and/or likenesses for purposes of advertising, promotion and publicity,
                for this Sweepstakes only, without further compensation, unless prohibited by law. </p>
              <p> Sponsor may prohibit
                an Entrant from participating in the Sweepstakes or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it
                determines that said Entrant is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes by
                cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices (including the use of automated quick entry
                programs) or intending to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other Entrants, Sponsor, or Sweepstakes
                Entities. </p>
              <p> If for any reason this Sweepstakes is not able to be conducted as planned, including, but not
                limited to, by reason of infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud
                or any other causes beyond the reasonable control of Sponsor which corrupt or affect the administration,
                security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Sweepstakes, then Sponsor reserves the right at
                its sole discretion to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Sweepstakes and randomly draw from those
                entries received up to the cancellation/suspension date to award prizes.
