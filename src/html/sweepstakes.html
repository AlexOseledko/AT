              <p> By
                participating in this Sweepstakes, Entrants, and prize winners release the Sponsor and each and all of
                the Sweepstakes Entities, from any and all liability, damages or causes of action (however named or

                materials submitted to Sponsor. </p>
              <p> In the event any portion of this Sweepstakes is compromised by
                activities beyond the control of the Sponsor which, in the sole opinion of the Sponsor, corrupt or
                impair the administration, security, fairness or proper play of the Sweepstakes or this Sweepstakes,
                Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion to modify, suspend or terminate the Sweepstakes. </p>
              <p>
                Winning a prize constitutes permission for Sponsor and its agencies to use prize winners' names,

              <p> Sponsor may prohibit
                an Entrant from participating in the Sweepstakes or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it
                determines that said Entrant is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes by
                cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices (including the use of automated quick entry
                programs) or intending to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other Entrants, Sponsor, or Sweepstakes
                Entities. </p>
              <p> If for any reason this Sweepstakes is not able to be conducted as planned, including, but not

                or any other causes beyond the reasonable control of Sponsor which corrupt or affect the administration,
