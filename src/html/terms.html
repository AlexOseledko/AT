            <p>16.1. <strong>This clause requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims on an individual
                basis and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. This clause will be construed
                under and be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding any other choice of law set out
                in these terms.</strong></p>
            <p>16.2. <strong>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree that all Claims pursued against us will be on an
                individual basis. Accordingly, you hereby waive your right to commence, to become a party to, or to

                action in any court, arbitration proceeding, or any other forum, against the other. You agree that
                any claim by or against us shall be heard in arbitration without joinder of parties or consolidation
                of such claim with any other person or entity’s claim, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by
                you and us.</strong></p>
            <p>16.3. We both agree to arbitrate.&nbsp;By agreeing to these Terms, both you and us agree to resolve
              any Disputes through final and binding arbitration.</p>

              contacting us within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your email must include your first and
              last name and a statement that you decline this arbitration clause. By opting out of this clause, you
              will not be precluded from using the Service, but neither you nor us will be able to invoke the mutual
              agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes. Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision.
              It is your decision to make and you rely solely on the information provided in these Terms. You should
              take reasonable steps to conduct further research and, if you wish, to consult with counsel of your
              choice.</p>
            <p>16.5. All arbitration shall be administered by either JAMS or the American Arbitration Association
              (AAA). The arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>16.6. The rules of the arbitral organization will govern payment of all arbitration fees and except
              as otherwise may be required by such rules, the arbitration will be held in in a mutually convenient
              location, or, at your election, conducted via telephone or other remote electronic means.</p>
            <p>16.7. We both agree that the arbitration of a Dispute will proceed on an individual basis and neither
              you nor us may bring a claim as a Collective Action.</p>
            <h4>17. Waiver of Class Action</h4>
            <p>17.1. <strong>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, whether the dispute is heard in
                arbitration or in court, neither you nor us will be entitled to consolidate, join or coordinate
                disputes with or involving other individuals or entities, or participate in any collective action
                (as defined above) or arbitrate or litigate any dispute in a representative capacity, including as a
                representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. In connection with any
                dispute (as defined above), all such rights are expressly and unconditionally waived.
                Notwithstanding, anything to the contrary in these terms, in the event all or any portion of clauses
                15 are found to be invalid or less than fully enforceable, then the entirety of this clause 16 may
                be deemed void and as having no effect upon either your or our election.</strong></p>
            <h4>18. Miscellaneous</h4>
